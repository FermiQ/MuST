# MuST
MuST is an ab initio electronic structure calculation software package, with petascale and beyond computing capability, for the first principles study of quantum phenomena in disordered materials. It is capable of performing KKR, KKR-CPA, and LSMS calculations for ordered or disordered structures.

## A sketch of MuST package
In the top directory of MuST, there are following files and directories: 

DESCRIPTION: A brief description of MuST project

GUIDE: A users guide explaining how to use the package

INSTALL: An instruction for how to build and install MuST

LICENSE: License information

Makefile: the makfile for building MuST

architecture/: contains architecture files for some selected systems and their environments

bin/: contains exectables for running KKR, KKR-CPA, LSMS, and WL-LSMS calculations.

Documentation/: repository for storing instructions, license information, and users guide.

external/: contains external libraries required or optionally required by MuST, e.g., FFTW, Lua, P3DFFT, and LibXC.

lsms/: contains LSMS and WL-LSMS codes targeted to extreme performance on petascale/exascale systems.
