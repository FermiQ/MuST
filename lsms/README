Steps to install lsms:
======================
1. ln -s arch/architecture_file architecture.h
2. make

Note -- 
make clean: delete object, library, and executable files generated from installation
make distclean: make clean + rm architecture.h

Executables under bin:
======================
1. lsms
The corresponding main source code is lsms/src/Main/lsms.cpp. It performs ab 
initio, linear scaling, electronic structure calculations for 3-d structures.
Main features:
   * Linear scaling calculation based on LSMS method
   * Muffin-tin potential
   * Non-relativistic, or Scalar-relativistic
   * Non-spin polarized, Spin-polarized, or Spin-canted
   * LDA or GGA for the exchange-correlation potentials
Execution:
   mpirun -np number_of_CPU_cores $(MuST_PATH)/bin/lsms < i_file
Example input files for various structures can be found under lsms/Test/.

2. wl-lsms
The corresponding main source code is lsms/src/Main/wl_lsms.cpp. It performs 
Wang-Landau Monte-Carlo simulation of random unit cell samples with energy data 
obtained from LSMS electronic structure calculation.
Main features:
   * Wang-Landau Monte-Carlo simulation method
   * Driving linear scaling ab initio calculation of the energy data for the unit 
     cell samples
Execution:
   mpirun -np number_of_CPU_cores $(MuST_PATH)/bin/wl-lsms < i_file
Example input files for various structures can be found under lsms/Test/.
