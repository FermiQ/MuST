This directory contains two performance benchmark cases for the muffin-tin, 
spin-canted, ab initio electronic structure calculation of CoCrFeMnNi high
entropy alloys with a FCC underlying lattice. The calculation is performed
using the LSMS method.

The input files for running mst2 include
i_mst: 
   contains the control parameters for running the SCF calculation
position.dat: 
   position data of the atoms in the unit cell
Co_v, Cr_v, Fe_v, Mn_v, Ni_v: 
   the starting potential data files for Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni, respectively
Evec_input.dat:
   the starting configuration of the magnetic (spin) moment orientations

In the MuST code, the MPI parallelization is performed at multiple levels, 
depending on the number of available MPI tasks. The primary paralleization
is performed by distributing the atoms, followed by distributing the energy
points on the complex energy contour, over the MPI tasks.
===========================================================================
u56/ and u56_CUDA/: 
   Input files for a unit cell with 56 atoms. 
   The calculation uses 32 energy points. The number of MPI tasks need to be 
   either multiples of 56 or a factor of 56, e.g., 
   7, 8, 14, 28, 56, 112, 224, 448  896, 1792

u56000/: 
   Input files for a unit cell with 56,000 atoms. 
   This random sample was generated using MuST/bin/genap. The input data for 
   running genap is inp_genap.
   The calculation uses 32 energy points. The number of MPI tasks need to be 
   either multiples of 56000 or a factor of 56000, e.g., 
   14000, 28000, 56000, 112000, 224000, 448000, etc.
