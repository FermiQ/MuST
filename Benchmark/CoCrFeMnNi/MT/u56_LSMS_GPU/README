The performance benchmark case for the muffin-tin, spin-canted, 
ab initio electronic structure calculation of CoCrFeMnNi high 
entropy alloys with a FCC underlying lattice. The calculation is performed
using the LSMS method on NVIDIA GPUs.

The MST2 will by default use the first GPU, even on a computing node with multi-GPUs.
To utilize multi-GPUs, we need to bind the MPI rank on different GPUs. 

In the script file "bind_MPI_to_GPU.sh", variable "ngpus" determines the GPU number in use.
For example, the MPI ranks will be equally distributed among two GPUs with setting ngpus = 2.
When there are in total 8 MPI ranks, rank 0-3 is on GPU0 and rank 4-7 is on GPU1.

An example for starting 8 MPI ranks with multi-GPU binding is: 
"mpirun -n 8 ./bind_MPI_to_GPU.sh mst2 < i_mst"
