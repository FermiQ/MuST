This directory contains two performance benchmark cases for the full-potential
spin-polarized, ab initio electronic structure calculation of CoCrFeMnNi high
entropy alloys with a FCC underlying lattice. The calculation is performed
using the LSMS method.

The input files for running mst2 include
i_mst: 
   contains the control parameters for running the SCF calculation
position.dat: 
   position data of the atoms in the unit cell
(Co_v, Cr_v, Fe_v, Mn_v, Ni_v) or CoCrFeMnNi_mt_v: 
   the starting potential data files for the unit cell sample

In the MuST code, the MPI parallelization is performed at multiple levels, 
depending on the number of available MPI tasks. The primary paralleization
is performed by distributing the atoms, followed by distributing the energy
points on the complex energy contour, over the MPI tasks.
===========================================================================
u32/: 
   Input files for a unit cell with 32 atoms. 
   The input potential for the Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni atoms is provided by
   Co_v, Cr_v, Fe_v, Mn_v, and Ni_v, respectively.
   This random sample was generated using MuST/bin/genap. The input data for 
   running genap is inp_genap.
   The calculation uses 32 energy points, and 256x256x256 uniform grid points. 
   The number of MPI tasks need to be both multiples of 32 and a factor of 
   256x256x256, e.g.,
   32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384

u2048/: 
   Input files for a unit cell with 2048 atoms. 
   The input potential for this 2048-atom sample is CoCrFeMnNi_mt_v, which is
   the output potential from a muffin-tin calculation for the same unit cell sample.
   This random sample was generated using MuST/bin/genap. The input data for 
   running genap is inp_genap.
   The calculation uses 32 energy points, and 512x512x512 uniform grid points. 
   The number of MPI tasks need to be both multiples of 2048 and a factor of
   512x512x512, e.g.,
   2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536
