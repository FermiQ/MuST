Installation steps:
===================
1. Under architecture/ directory, create/modify an architecture file by following an existing example file;

2. In the top directory (MuST/), run the following commands to build executables
make architecture-file-name (e.g., make linux-intel-nogpu)
make install

Note --
make clean: delete the object, library, executable files under lsms and MST from installation
make distclean: delete the object, library, executable, and architecture.h files under lsms and MST from installation; also
                delete the executables under bin/.

Alternative steps:
==================
The code MST (under MST/) and LSMS/WL-LSMS (under lsms/) can be built separately by running make under MST 
and lsms. The executables can be found under MST/bin and lsms/bin, respectively. It requires to create 
archietecture.h under MST and lsms using symbolic link. Steps are as follows:
* To build MST,
1. cd MST
2. set SystemName in Makefile (at line 6) to a proper name, or execute the following command:
   ln -s arch/architecture_file architecture.h
3. make
* To build LSMS/WL-LSMS,
1. cd lsms
2. ln -s arch/architecture_file architecture.h
3. make
