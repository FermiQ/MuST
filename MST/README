     calculation case.
Output files:
   * o_n* file: This file contains the major output information. Note that
     it will not be created if the output is instructed (in the i_* input file)
     to be printed out to the screen.
   * k_n* file: This file contains a brief information of the total energy
     and the Fermi energy from each SCF iteration

     obtained from the S-matrix.
   * del_*: The file contains the DOS and the integrated DOS calculated from
     the Krein formula and Green function formula.

     that contained in del_* file.
