Three computational examples for Fe are presented here:

pola/: a spin-polarized calculation of BCC Fe with ferromagnetic spin alignment

cant/: a spin-canted calculation of BCC Fe in which the spin on the corner atom is aligned along the z-direction and the spin on the body center atom is aligned in the x-direction.

spin-dynamics/: a spin-dynamics calculation of BCC Fe with 10 time steps. The starting configuration is such that the spin on the corner atom is aligned along the z-direction and 
the spin on the body center atom is aligned in the x-direction. During the similation, the corning spin is held still and the body center spin is allowed to rotate.
