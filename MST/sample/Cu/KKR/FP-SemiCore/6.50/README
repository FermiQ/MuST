It is found that running with directly setting "Default No. Rad Points ndivin  :: 2001" is difficult to converge. 
I have to take the following steps to achieve the convergence:
1. Set "Default No. Rad Points ndivin  :: 1201"
2. Set "Default No. Rad Points ndivin  :: 1501"
3. Set "Default No. Rad Points ndivin  :: 1801"
4. Set "Default No. Rad Points ndivin  :: 1901"
and finally
5. Set "Default No. Rad Points ndivin  :: 2001"
