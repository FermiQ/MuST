This tutorial shows how to run MuST + Phonopy to calculate the phonon properties for a selected set of materials. The approach is to use MuST to perform the full-potential KKR/LSMS
calculations to determine the forces acting on each atom in the supercells with small atomic displacements generated by Phonopy. The force data for each supercell are stored in
mstrun.xml, which can be processed by Phonopy to produce FORCE_SETS file.

The steps to run the MuST+Phonopy calculations are shown below.
==============================================================

STEP 0. Prepare the following input files for running full-potential KKR/LSMS calculations
    i_mst : control parameter file
    POSCAR: position data in VASP POSCAR format
    *_mt_v: muffin-tin potential file(s) in ascii data format for the targetted metal or compound


STEP 1. Use phonopy to generate supercells with atomic displacements. This will produce SPOSCAR, POSCAR-*, and phonopy_disp.yaml files.
> phonopy -d --dim "2 2 2" --pa auto


STEP 2. Create a sub-directory for each supercell with the displacements, and copy the corresponding POSCAR-* file, starting potential(s), and i_mst to each sub-directory.
> MuST/scripts/phonopy_preproc -i i_mst  (or phonopy_preproc --input i_mst)


STEP 3. Run MuST calculation in each sub-directory, and make sure that the full-potential calculations are converged so that the force data are properly written in the 
mstrun.xml file in each sub-rirectory


STEP 4. Use phonopy command to generate FORCE_SETS data
> phonopy -f disp-*/mstrun.xml


Post-processing examples
========================
A. To produce a phonon band between a set of high symetry points (e.g., G, X, K, and L), and save it to band.pdf, run the following command:
> phonopy --band "0.0 0.0 0.0   0.5 0.0 0.0   0.5 0.5 0.0   0.0 0.0 0.0   0.5 0.5 0.5" --band-labels "$\Gamma$ X K $\Gamma$ L" --dim "2 2 2" -s -p


B. To produce a phonon DOS between a frequency range, e.g. (-1, 10) with 0.005 pitch, and MESH_NUMBERS = 41 41 41, run the following command:
> phonopy --dos --fmin -1 --fmax 10 --fpitch 0.005 --mesh "41 41 41" --dim "2 2 2" -s -p
