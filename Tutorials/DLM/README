This directory contains examples for running disordered local moment (DLM) calculations for magnetic structures.
To run DLM calculations, one needs to take the following setups in preparing the input data:
1. In the position data, the sublattice with DLM structure needs to look like:
   "  CPA    x   y   z   species_1  content_of_species_1   species_2   content_of_species_2 ...,..."
   where species_1 is a character string to identify the species with moment state 1, while the 1st 1 or 2 characters of species_1 need to identify the chemical element, e.g., 
   species_1 = Mn1, Fe_1, etc.

2. Create starting potentials for species_1, species_2, etc. Notice that the 2nd line of each potential file may look like
   "   2   -0.6046396135934D-04"
   Append "species_1     spin_flip_flag", "species_2   spin_flip_flag   ", respectively, to the 2nd line of each potential file, so that the 2nd line becomes
   "   2   -0.6046396135934D-04i        species_1        spin_flip_flag" 
   where spin_flip_flag = 0 or 1. For spin_flip_flag=1, the potential data for the spin-up iand spin-down channels in the file will be flipped when read in; 
   otherwise (spin_flip_flag=0) the potential data for the spin-up iand spin-down channels will not be flipped.
   Note that this change to the starting potential will allow the MuST code to identify the potential for the chemical species with alternative names, i.e., species_1, 
   species_2, etc.

3. In the input parameter file, set the Method of SCF calculation to 3, i.e., KKR-CPA.
